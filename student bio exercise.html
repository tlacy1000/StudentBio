        Hi I'm Lacy, and this is my student bio page! I'm learning how to code, so I really hope this works once I'm done!
      A little about me: I did my undergrad in Behavioral Neuroscience- my favorite areas are psychopharmacology and neurodegenerative diseases.
      I hope to carry out research on the efficacy of LSD assisted cognitive behavioral therapy for mood disorders. The picture that's (hopefully)
  displayed here is of when I presented my behavioral economics research at my most recent national conference- APS 2019.
A super cool thing that happened there was that I met one of my research idols- Dr. Jeanne Tsai of the Stanford culture and emotion lab.
I actually had no idea she was presenting until I saw her name on a program. Pretty neat, huh? Not every day that you get to meet your heroes!
Other things I ike to do when I'm not in the lab include painting, catching live jazz and practicing music. I play the piano, baritone and trumpet. If you're ever curious,
please feel free to ask me things about neuroscience, biology, psychology, pain perception or drugs! I always love to share things with people! </main>
